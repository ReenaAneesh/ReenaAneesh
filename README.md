## 🎯 Featured Project

### Pantaloons TMS 2.0 – End-to-End Implementation Journey (ABFRL)

**Role:** Sr. Customer Success & Implementation – Caliper Business Solutions  
**Client:** Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd. (ABFRL) – Pantaloons  
**Timeline:** 2024 – 2025  
**Platform:** tEG (Transport & Execution Gateway)

#### Project Overview
Pantaloons (ABFRL) required a unified Transport Management System (TMS) to digitize logistics workflows — from vehicle indenting and contracting to tracking milestones and vendor reconciliation. This implementation covered both inbound and outbound supply chains with API integrations, milestone analytics, and DPH automation.

#### Implementation Scope

| Module | Functionality |
|--------|---------------|
| Admin & API Gateway | Master data, API integrations, DPH settings |
| Indenting (VIVO) | Vehicle indent creation & assignment |
| Milestone Tracking | Live trip status & delay categorization |
| Contracting | Vendor contract management with TAT & DPH |
| Reconciliation | Vendor billing, validation & payment readiness |
| Exception Handling | Non-pickup, manual LR & re-routing |

#### Architecture Flow
```
ERP → tEG TMS → LSPs (Moglix/VRL etc.)
```

#### Key Modules Implemented

**Admin & API Gateway**  
Master setup, API integration, DPH settings, and LR/AWB management.

**Indenting Module (VIVO)**  
Vehicle indent creation, trip allocation, and mapping between LSPs and DCs.

**Milestone Tracking**  
Track movement progress and categorize delays or exceptions.

**Contracting Module**  
Manage vendor contracts, lanes, and auto-apply DPH slabs.

**Diesel Price Hike (DPH) Logic**  
Automated slab-wise DPH rate computation for contracts and reconciliation.

**Reconciliation Module**  
Bill validation through color-coded reconciliation for payment readiness.

**Exception Management**  
Manual LRs, failed API tracking, and no-show handling.

#### Outcomes & Learnings
✅ Unified tracking
