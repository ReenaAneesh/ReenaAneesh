#### Architecture Flow
```
ERP → tEG TMS → LSPs (Moglix/VRL etc.)
```

#### Key Modules Implemented

**Admin & API Gateway**  
Master setup, API integration, DPH settings, and LR/AWB management.

**Contracting Module**  
Manage vendor contracts, lanes, and auto-apply DPH slabs.

**Diesel Price Hike (DPH) Logic**  
Automated slab-wise DPH rate computation for contracts and reconciliation.

**Reconciliation Module**  
Bill validation through color-coded reconciliation for payment readiness.

**Exception Management**  
Manual LRs, failed API tracking, and no-show handling.
